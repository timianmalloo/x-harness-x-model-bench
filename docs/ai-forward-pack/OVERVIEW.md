# AI-Forward Pack — Overview

The practical orientation to the bundle: **how to install it, what it contains, and how to use the skills.** For *why* each piece exists, see `README.md`; for the evidence and design decisions behind it, `research-synthesis.md`.

The pack is a repository-droppable extension to the **Agent Knowledge Pack**. It turns that pack's adversarial reviewer council into a working swarm — collaborating peers that *author*, adversarial personas that *attack*, and a staged reasoning discipline that slows the rush to a plausible answer and replaces it with evidence. It works with **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Grok Build**, **Antigravity**, or any combination.

## 1. How to install

The pack is installed by **manual reconciliation** — it's all text, and every source path has exactly one destination per host. The deployment map, the ready-to-paste managed blocks (`adapters/managed-blocks/`), the Copilot frontmatter wrap, the Grok path map (`.grok/rules/grok-surface.md`), the Antigravity path map (`.agents/rules/agy-surface.md`), and the update procedure are in **`adapters/INSTALL.md`** (installed copy: `docs/ai-forward-pack/INSTALL.md`) — whose **frontmatter `changes` changelog** is the refresh guide: on a repo refresh, read "what changed since the last version" and apply exactly those re-copies and managed-block re-pastes. In short: knowledge → `.claude/knowledge/` + `.github/instructions/` (wrapped; Grok and Antigravity read the `.claude/knowledge/` copies), skills → `.claude/skills/` + `.github/prompts/` + `.grok/skills/` + `.agents/skills/`, all 23 agents → every host's agent directory, templates + pack docs → `docs/ai-forward-pack/`, the Docs Explorer template → `docs/index.html` (one-time copy), the managed block in `AGENTS.md`, the Grok path map in `.grok/rules/`, and the Antigravity path map in `.agents/rules/`.

**What lands in your repo** (for `--tool both`):

```
<repo>/
├─ CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md             # a managed block is added (your own content is preserved)
├─ .claude/  (knowledge, skills, agents)      ← Claude Code

```

## 2. What it contains

Three foundations, a roster, and the skills that put them to work.

**The reasoning spine.**
- **Rigor Protocol** (`knowledge/rigor-protocol.md`) — a staged, broad-to-narrow discipline in six stages: **0 Rush Interdiction → 1 OPEN → 2 INTERROGATE → 3 EVIDENCE → 4 DISCONFIRM → 5 CONVERGE**. It scales with the work's tier; every conclusion carries a confidence label and a residual risk.
- **Spike Protocol** (`knowledge/spike-protocol.md`) — read-the-code and run-a-PoC before depending on any unfamiliar API, SDK, or MCP server, so designs rest on established contracts, not guessed semantics.
- **UI Archetype Grammar** (`knowledge/ui-archetype-grammar.md`, G1–G16, + the catalog `ui-archetype-catalog.md`) — a hardened, EBNF-valid **two-layer grammar** that **identifies a UI/UX template** by its routing/temporal/data archetype and uses it as a **determinism control** for code generation: a coarse **Archetype Signature** (the selector) composed with the U1–U20 token/state/flow spec (the concrete fill). The catalog carries **16 archetypes** with live exemplars, canonical signatures, and model-agnostic codegen descriptors. `/specify` records the signature in Part C, `/design-slice` resolves each facet, `/implement` builds to it — so an agent in Claude Code or Copilot reaches for the right archetype instead of regressing to a generic dashboard.
- **Specification Standards** (`knowledge/specification-standards.md`, S1–S10) — a spec is **one document with three separable, individually-owned layers**, written abstract-to-concrete and gated **bottom-up** (Garrett's Five Planes): **Functional** (what & why — ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 + user stories with Gherkin + ISO 25010 NFRs; owner Product Strategist), **UX specification** (how it *works* — information architecture, user flows covering the alternate/error/recovery paths, wireframe-level structure; owner the new **UX Researcher / IA**), and **UI specification** (how it *looks* — specified to U1–U20; owner UX & Accessibility). UX precedes UI; each absent layer is marked **N/A with a reason**, never dropped. `/specify` writes all three; the gate reviews bottom-up.
- **UI & Interaction Design Standard** (`knowledge/ui-interaction-design.md`, U1–U20) — whenever the work has a user-facing interface on *any* medium (web, native, mobile, CLI, voice), this governs whether it's **excellent**: a **design-token system** (primitive/semantic/component with theme/density/platform modes — no arbitrary values), the craft canon (hierarchy, space, type/color systems, purposeful motion, real in-voice copy), **complete component states** (the empty/loading/error states polish usually skips), Jakob's-Law familiarity, and for AI-facing UIs the **HAX 18 guidelines** + **Shape-of-AI** pattern families (Wayfinders, Tuners, Governors, Trust builders, Identifiers) with the wrong answer designed as a first-class state. **WCAG 2.2 AA** and a named **performance budget** are floors. `/specify` names the bar, `/design-slice` specifies the interface, `/implement` builds and proves it — the **UX & Accessibility lens holds the veto**.
- **Knowledge Visualization & Docs Explorer Standard** (`knowledge/knowledge-visualization.md`, V1–V18) — all repo knowledge is **one typed graph** whose record is each artifact's **YAML frontmatter** (id, type, **owner**, typed links per the **relation registry**, **review-by** freshness SLA, summary); `docs/docs-index.js` is the *derived* projection, and `docs/` doubles as a valid **Obsidian vault** for free. The **Docs Explorer** (`docs/index.html`) renders hierarchy, graph, and mind-map projections plus a **health view** (stale, orphan, and review-suggested nodes) and Mermaid/UML diagrams. A first-class **glossary** anchors domain terms (`uses-term` edges), grounding **traverses the graph** with the path as provenance (V15), **material changes propagate** `review-suggested` flags to inbound neighbors (V16), sub-ADR decisions and assumptions are captured as linked **decision notes** (V17), every content-creating skill writes frontmatter + syncs the index as its **last action** (V10), and all graph mechanics run through the stdlib-only **script bundle** (`scripts/docs-graph.py`: inventory · derive · validate · freshness · flag · stub) instead of prompt-time scripting (V18).
- **Audit & Change Log Standard** (`knowledge/audit-and-change-log.md`, AL/CL) — the project keeps a **durable, committed history** so work compounds across sessions: an append-only **audit log** (`docs/audit/audit-log.jsonl`) of every meaningful prompt/skill/script — every skill appends an entry as its last action (the **Audit Mandate**) — and a curated **change log** (`docs/audit/change-log.jsonl`) of design decisions, where `/collectknowledge`, `/define-architecture`, `/design-slice`, and `/migrate` capture the prompt, the result, and the **git context before and after** (the **Change Mandate**). It is the committed counterpart to a session's ephemeral store, registered in the graph as the `docs/audit/audit-log.md` hub node, browsable as a searchable timeline (`docs/audit/index.html`) or via `/auditlog`, and written only through `scripts/audit-log.py`.
- **Observability & Instrumentation Standard** (`knowledge/observability-and-instrumentation.md`) — code emits structured, trace-correlated telemetry in the **OpenTelemetry data model** (regardless of the concrete logging library), with **stable error codes** and **RFC 9457** error responses, so production failures are debuggable and logs correlate to traces. `/design-slice` and `/implement` enforce it; the SRE owns it.

**The dual-mode persona model** (`knowledge/collaborative-personas.md`). A persona is a lens worn two ways: in **Peer Mode** it builds the best possible thing; in **Adversary Mode** the same lens attacks the proposed thing. Ideation runs in Peer Mode, review in Adversary Mode, and one integrity rule holds throughout — **the author never clears its own hard veto.**

**The roster — 23 lenses**, every one rendered as a uniform §8 card (`knowledge/persona-cards.md`) with a convene-when trigger, a Peer-Mode deliverable, a severity scale, a falsifiable veto-clears-when predicate, and the anti-patterns it owns:
- **11 adversaries** from your catalog (Enterprise / Test / Security / Distributed-Systems / Patterns architects, Tech Lead, SRE, the C#/Rust/Python developers, the Simplifier).
- **3 peer-first roles** this pack adds (Orchestrator, Product Strategist, Domain Researcher).
- **4 governance adversaries** added after an audit (AI Systems Engineer, Data & Persistence Architect, Privacy & Data Governance Counsel, Release / Deployment Engineer).
- **4 UI/app & documentation lenses** (Mobile App Developer, Native Desktop Developer, UX & Accessibility, Documentation Steward).
The reasoning behind every seat — and the seats deliberately *not* added — is in `knowledge/persona-audit.md`, which also defines the **Persona Operating Standard**: the severity scale (Blocker/Major/Minor/Nit), the confidence labels (Verified/Inferred/Flagged), the falsifiable veto-clears-when predicates, and the deterministic veto-conflict rule (true hard-vs-hard ties escalate to you).

**Per-project domain experts.** The 23 are domain-*general*. Subject-matter lenses (finance, CFD, clinical, legal…) are added per repo by `/adddomainexperts` and recorded in that repo's `docs/domain-experts.md`.

**The system tests itself.** `evals/` is the pack's own regression suite — golden tasks per skill with objective trajectory assertions (the artifact exists, frontmatter valid, the FMA/STRIDE/phasing fingerprints present, `docs-graph.py validate` clean); skills are prompt-code and are tested like it. `ci/docs-health.yml` is a ready-to-copy GitHub Actions workflow gating PRs on graph health, freshness, and vendored-foundation drift. `knowledge/FOUNDATION.md` + `scripts/foundation-check.py` make divergence between the vendored base docs and your canonical base pack visible (normalized hashes; known intentional divergences cataloged, currently three pending back-port). `docs-graph.py snapshot` appends the governance-health trend every /document run.

**The artifacts.** 28 templates in `templates/` (spec, architecture, design, ADR, investigation, proof-pack, domain-expert, knowledge-base, documentation-bundle, the **glossary**, the **decision note**, the **project-memory** ledger, the **threat model** and **privacy review** rollups, the **native-UI proof pack**, the **session contract**, the **design-language** doc (Stitch DESIGN.md extended with the pack floors) and its **preview** HTML, the self-contained doc-viewer HTML, the **Docs Explorer** HTML that becomes `docs/index.html`, the **audit & change-log viewer** HTML that becomes `docs/audit/index.html`, and the **UI capability guide** HTML that becomes `docs/ui-guide.html`). The artifact templates all carry the V2 frontmatter header. Worked examples live in `examples/finance-repo/` and `examples/design-languages/`.

**The foundation (vendored, so the bundle is self-contained).** The Agent Knowledge Pack docs this pack builds on ship inside `knowledge/` and install alongside everything else: the **Body of Knowledge**, the **Rules of the Road**, the **Persona Catalog**, the **Layered-Optimized Architecture**, **Engineering Governance**, the **Testing Strategy**, and the **C# Style Guide**. They're heavily referenced throughout the skills and personas; bundling them means the pack works in a repo that doesn't already have the base pack. (They're *copies* — if you maintain the base pack separately, refresh them when it changes.)

## 3. How to use the skills

There are **28 skills** — six that carry a piece of work from idea to shipped code (`/specify`, `/define-architecture`, `/design-slice`, `/ui-design`, `/implement`, `/investigate`), eight that support them (knowledge collection, persona tailoring, execution-graph planning, documentation, brownfield **adoption**, whole-repo **forensic review**, characterization-first **migration**, and **code-hygiene** review/fix), three **pack-lifecycle** skills that manage the pack installation itself (**/addpacktorepo**, **/updatepack**, and **/extendaibundle**), two **utility** skills (**/auditlog** and **/also**), and two **prompt-log utilities** (**/prompts** and **/searchprompts**). The workflow/support skills form the engineering surface below; lifecycle and utility skills sit outside it.

**Built-in delivery discipline.** `/define-architecture` *defines completely but phases vertically*: the whole architecture is specified, then delivery is partitioned into end-to-end vertical slices (Phase 1 a walking skeleton; mocks at unbuilt edges as contract seams) so serial implementation always yields a deployable, human-validatable increment. `/design-slice` performs a mandatory **failure-mode analysis** (each mode → an explicit disposition: prevent/detect/mitigate/recover/accept) and `/implement` carries every mode into code + a negative test. And `/define-architecture`, `/design-slice`, and `/implement` each **end with a status table** — completed / remaining / best next action — so you always know where the build stands.

**How you invoke them.** In **Claude Code**, the skills install to `.claude/skills/` and apply automatically by their description, or you can call one explicitly (e.g. *"run /specify on this idea: …"*). In **GitHub Copilot**, each skill installs as a prompt in `.github/prompts/`; invoke it in chat as `/specify`, `/design-slice`, etc., with your input. In **Grok Build**, skills install to `.grok/skills/` (slash `/specify`, …) and personas spawn with `spawn_subagent` (`subagent_type` = the persona `name`). Either way the skill convenes the right personas as peers to author and as adversaries to review — you don't summon agents by hand.

**The natural flow** (use only the steps a given piece of work needs):

```
/collectknowledge → /adddomainexperts → /specify → /define-architecture → /design-slice → /implement → /document
                                                                                          ↑
                                                                  /investigate  (whenever a defect appears)
```

**Quick reference**

| Skill | Use it when… | You get | Convened (peers → adversaries) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **/collectknowledge** | starting in an unfamiliar or high-stakes domain, before design | `docs/knowledge/<topic>/` — sourced, confidence-labeled domain knowledge | Domain Researcher, Product Strategist → Domain Researcher (adversary), Simplifier |
| **/adddomainexperts** | the project has a real subject-matter domain | domain-expert personas + `docs/domain-experts.md` | Orchestrator, Product Strategist, Domain Researcher → Simplifier, Tech Lead, Data |
| **/specify** | turning an idea or prompt into a testable spec | `docs/specs/<feature>.md` with acceptance criteria | Product Strategist, Domain Researcher → Simplifier, Test Architect, Security (if data/identity), UX (if a UI) |
| **/define-architecture** | a new system or a load-bearing architecture decision | `docs/architecture.md` + ADRs | Enterprise/Distributed/Security architects, AI Systems, Data → full council, SRE, Privacy, Release |
| **/design-slice** | a component or feature inside an existing architecture | `docs/design/<component>.md` + test plan | Patterns Expert, Simplifier, language Dev (+ UX/platform if UI) → Security, Distributed, Test Architect |
| **/implement** | turning a design into tested code | code + tests + a Proof Pack | language Developer ⇄ Test Architect (pair) → Test Architect, SRE, architects, Release |
| **/investigate** | a defect that needs a verified root cause | `docs/investigations/<id>.md`: root cause + specific fix + failure-class generalization + phased repair plan — then stops for your review | SRE, Distributed Systems → Security, Test Architect, Data |
| **/document** | standing up docs, or keeping them current | `docs/` bundle (API ref + 4 diagram families) + the full-sweep Docs Explorer index + `_site` close-up + freshness hook | Documentation Steward, language Dev, Patterns Expert → Steward (adversary), Simplifier, Test Architect |
| **/adopt** | bringing an existing (brownfield) repo into the pack | recovered `docs/architecture.md` (C4, confidence-labeled) + frontmattered existing docs + seeded glossary + the first index/Explorer + a vertically-phased adoption plan | Enterprise Architect + Documentation Steward |
| **/forensicreview** | assessing the true state and risk of an existing repo | rebuilt truth-to-code architecture/docs + `docs/reviews/forensic-review.md` + a P0–P3 backlog separating risks, verified issues, and todos | Enterprise Architect + Documentation Steward → full applicable council, Test Architect evidence gate |
| **/migrate** | dependency/framework upgrades and large refactors | characterization tests green on the old stack first + vertical increments + the equivalence report with the intentional-difference catalog + V16 flags to dependents | language Developer (Test Architect's characterization veto) |
| **/code-hygiene** | holding a codebase to the coding guidelines — dead code, commented-out code, anti-patterns | `docs/hygiene/backlog.md` with an aggregate of violating LOC and % of codebase per class (`review`) + a TDD-guarded, git-labelled, phased remediation plan (`fix`) | The Simplifier, language Dev, Test Architect → Test Architect (hard veto), Security, Tech Lead |
| **/addpacktorepo** | installing the pack into another local repo (run from an AI-Forward clone) | the full pack deployed to the target (knowledge, skills, agents, templates, managed blocks) + a tabular install summary + explainer/docs pointers + a commit offer | Enterprise Architect + Release Engineer + Documentation Steward |
| **/updatepack** | refreshing a repo that already has the pack to the latest revision | only the changelog delta applied (knowledge/skills/agents + managed-block re-pastes) + a tabular action summary + advanced revision + a commit offer | Release Engineer + Documentation Steward |
| **/extendaibundle** | adding a new capability (skill/knowledge/template/script) to the pack itself from a prose prompt | collect→specify→design→implement compressed for pack work; scaffolded via `new-capability.py`, proven by `verify-bundle.ps1` (BUNDLE CONSISTENT) — both tool surfaces, an eval, reconciled counts, bumped revision, zero drift | Tech Lead + Documentation Steward (Test Architect + Release Engineer gate) |
| **/auditlog** | recalling what was done or decided in this repo, or re-running a past prompt | the last N actions / a search of the durable audit & change log / a recalled prompt to re-run / the searchable timeline viewer | — (a reader/dispatcher over `audit-log.py`; logs nothing itself) |

**A worked example — a new feature in an unfamiliar domain.**
1. **`/collectknowledge`** with the domain and problem you're solving → a sourced knowledge base in `docs/knowledge/` the whole team reasons from.
2. **`/adddomainexperts`** → adds the subject-matter lenses that domain needs (they cite the knowledge base) and registers them in the repo's roster.
3. **`/specify`** → a testable spec; the Test Architect rejects any acceptance criterion that can't fail, the Simplifier strips gold-plating.
4. **`/define-architecture`** (new system) or **`/design-slice`** (within an existing one) → the structure, with unfamiliar contracts proven by the Spike Protocol and load-bearing decisions captured as ADRs.
5. **`/implement`** → the language Developer and Test Architect pair in red→green→refactor; you get tested code and a Proof Pack.
6. **`/document`** → the API reference, the four diagram families, and the browsable view — with an after-commit check so they never drift.

**Two things hold across every skill.** Each runs the Rigor Protocol scaled to the work's **tier** (a trivial change runs a quick self-check; a load-bearing one runs all six stages with an external adversary). And the integrity rule never bends: claims carry a **confidence label**, contracts are **verified by execution rather than recalled**, and the **author never clears its own hard veto.**
