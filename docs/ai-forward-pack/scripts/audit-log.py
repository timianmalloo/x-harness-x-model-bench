"""audit-log.py — the AI-Forward Pack audit & change log bundle (audit-and-change-log.md).

Durable, committed, history-as-knowledge for a repo: an append-only record of every
meaningful prompt / skill / script / decision, so any future Copilot or Claude Code
session reads the project's own history instead of starting blind. The canonical logs
are append-only JSONL (clean git diffs, like docs/health-history.jsonl); the viewer
reads a derived window.AUDIT_DATA JS (loadable over file://, like docs/docs-index.js).
Python 3.8+, stdlib only — no dependencies.

Two logs, one bundle:
  docs/audit/audit-log.jsonl    every action (shortname, datetime, session, prompt, summary, …)
  docs/audit/change-log.jsonl   the meaningful design changes / decisions (+ git before/after)
  docs/audit/audit-data.js      derived window.AUDIT_DATA = {audit:[…], changes:[…]} (the viewer's data)
  docs/audit/index.html         the interactive viewer (self-bootstrapped from the template)

Subcommands
  append      Add an audit entry.            (Audit Mandate — every skill's last action)
  change      Add a change-log entry.        (Change Mandate — collectknowledge/define-architecture/design-slice/migrate)
  list        Show the last N entries (audit|change). For the CLI skill.
  search      Filter by --session / --since / --until / --keyword. For the CLI skill.
  get         Print one entry by --id (use --field prompt to extract the prompt to re-run).
  render      Regenerate audit-data.js from the JSONL and ensure the viewer exists (repair).
  git-context Print the current git {sha, short, branch, pushed} as JSON (a helper).
  verify      Fail when any log line is unreadable — the system of record must never lose
              an entry silently (FR-052). CI-able.
  suggest     Discern unlogged meaningful changes (recent commits + new ADRs/notes not in the change log).
  import      Ingest a session-export JSON array of turns into the audit log (build on session history).

Conventions
  --root defaults to docs/. The audit dir is <root>/audit. The viewer template is resolved
  relative to this script (pack/templates or docs/ai-forward-pack/templates). git is optional —
  every git call degrades gracefully when git or a repo is absent. This tool never invents a
  prompt or a summary; required fields must be supplied (flags, --*-file, or --from-json -).

# --- per-run spans: make PARALLELISM measurable (P8, IO2) ----------------------------
# Summed agent time cannot distinguish serial from parallel. A profiled session reported
# 67 runs totalling 152.6 minutes and called that proof of fan-out, but 152.6 minutes sits
# comfortably inside its ~240 minutes of wall clock -- fully serial execution fits the same
# numbers. The claim was unfalsifiable because only DURATIONS were recorded.
#
# A start and an end per run fixes that: the union of the intervals is the wall clock the
# work actually occupied, and speedup = summed / union. Idle gaps between waves are excluded
# from the union, so a long quiet period cannot understate the parallelism that did happen.

    P6 / class CTX-F: the fourth field is the branch's tool calls against the budget it was

    It is optional, and the three-field form still parses: every entry already in the log
    uses it, and breaking those to add a field is not a fix. A malformed budget leaves the
    SPAN usable and records no budget -- the interval is still good evidence, and losing the
    parallelism measurement over a typo would cost more than it saves.

    This is a RECORD, not an enforcement. No harness mediates a sub-agent's tool count, and
