# Decision Interrogation

Use this pattern when an unanswered question would materially change the artifact. It is ordinary
conversation, not a separate security, privacy, identity, or persistence system.

## DI1 - Resolve before asking

Check facts yourself when repository evidence, documentation, or a quick experiment can answer
them. Ask the human only for a preference, priority, trade-off, or product decision that evidence
cannot settle.

## DI2 - Keep the fast path

If no consequential question remains, continue. Do not manufacture an interrogation round.

## DI3 - Orient once

Before the first question, show all currently known questions:

| Question | Needed for | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|

Keep each cell brief. The recommendation includes one sentence of reasoning.

## DI4 - Ask serially

Ask one question at a time. Prefer the harness's structured question tool. If it is unavailable,
ask one ordinary chat question and wait. Include suggested choices when useful, but always allow a
free-form answer.

After each answer, update the remaining list. Do not ask a question made irrelevant by an earlier
answer.

## DI5 - Handle deferral honestly

Allow deferral only when the affected artifact section can stay explicitly unresolved. State what
cannot be finalized and what later decision will unblock it. Never silently turn deferral into the
recommendation.

## DI6 - Close before handoff

Before handing off from `/specify`, `/ui-design`, `/define-architecture`, or `/design-slice`:

1. identify remaining consequential questions;
2. if any exist, show the table and resolve them one by one;
3. record resolved decisions in the artifact;
4. list deferred questions and their impact;
5. continue only when the artifact is honest about what remains open.

`/specify` and `/ui-design` also apply DI1-DI5 during authoring when an early answer prevents wasted
work.
