"""coord-core.py - agent coordination, Phase 1 walking skeleton.

Holds the record of intent and answers "may this session touch this artifact?" from it.
Append-only JSONL, one file per session; every piece of state is a fold over it. No daemon,
no database, no dependency beyond the standard library (ADR-0007).

Four controls here were observed failing on the un-fixed shape before they were trusted:
  LOG-A     an append onto a file not ending in a newline fuses two records and loses BOTH
  R4        a check that scanned nothing must not report "free"
  CTRL-PORT os.open without O_BINARY translates newlines on Windows -- which also MASKED
            the LOG-A control, because a stray CR still terminates a line
  F8        a claim over the coordination record itself would lock the substrate

    the primary checkout it returns a relative ".git". Its parent is the primary checkout

    Found by running the Phase-1 demo: with the root defaulting to cwd/.agents, every

    which is the exact criterion this phase exists to satisfy.

    at 82 ms p95, which met NFR-P1 but blew straight through ADR-0007's own 60 ms
    compaction trigger. On the hot path of every edit, a subprocess is not free.

A git worktree SHARES `.git/config` and `.git/hooks` with its parent -- there is no
per-worktree config unless `extensions.worktreeConfig` is set, and it is off by default.
"Per-clone" is true; "therefore per-worktree" does not follow. So an install here does not
ADD a registration: it OVERWRITES the repository's one registration, and the pre-commit
floor with it, using a path inside THIS tree.

The tree is temporary and WT8 cleanup deletes it. Every later merge of the paths
.gitattributes declares would then invoke a script that is not there -- and there is no
signature before that moment, because the path resolves and names a byte-identical script.

  remedy    the primary checkout already carries the registration this tree inherits, so
            there is nothing to do here. If it does not, install THERE:
              cd {primary}

    `driver_status` asks whether a driver is declared and registered. Both were true in the

    temporary worktree, because the pack told every agent to run `coord install` in one.
    A worktree SHARES .git/config, so that install did not add a registration, it replaced
    the repository's. WT8 cleanup then deletes the tree, and every declared path merges by
    invoking a script that is not there.

    There is no signature while the tree exists: the path resolves and names a byte-identical
    script. So the question `doctor` has to ask is not "is a driver registered" but "where
    does it point, and does that place outlive this merge". The primary checkout is the
    answer, because it is the only tree the repository cannot lose.

    The hazard is narrow and worth stating precisely: a path inside a LINKED WORKTREE,
