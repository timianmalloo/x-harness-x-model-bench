"""session-profile.py — measure how agent sessions actually ran, across harnesses and models.

Instrumentation over inference (IO1) pointed at the agent's own work: instead of reasoning
about why a session felt slow, expensive or drifty, READ the telemetry every harness already
writes to disk and turn it into a findings table (what happened, with evidence) and a fixes
table (which pack surface owns the control). This is the "asleep half" of continuous
improvement (`/dream`) specialised to performance, efficiency, task adherence, fan-out and
cross-harness coordination — the /session-profiler skill drives it.

Sources (all local, all read-only):

  GitHub Copilot CLI   ~/.copilot/session-store.db        sessions, turns, assistant_usage_events
                       ~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/events.jsonl   the full event stream
                       ~/.copilot/settings.json           model / contextTier / effortLevel
  Claude Code          ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl    the transcript
                       ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl (+ .meta.json)
                                                          every sub-agent: model, requests, tokens,
                                                          tool calls and waits, context, span, resumes

Cost is reported in TOKENS and REQUESTS (the units a subscription-bound operator can act on),
`_meta.quota` where the harness carries it, and dollars ONLY as an "if API-billed" estimate at
first-party list rates that are printed beside every figure (LIST_RATES, with the date they
were cached) - never as a bill.

A repo is selected by path (`--repo <path>`, repeatable). Copilot sessions match on cwd or the
`owner/name` remote; Claude Code sessions match on the project slug of the repo path and of each
of its git worktrees. Every number is either read from the store or labelled as an estimate;
a measurement path that does not exist reports "not recorded", never a plausible number (IO8).

Subcommands
  discover   list the sessions found for the repo(s) in the window
  profile    per-turn metrics + findings + fixes for the selected sessions; writes
             docs/profiles/<sp-id>/{profile.json,profile.md} in the FIRST --repo (or --out-root)
  compare    aggregate the same metrics by model family x harness (the tuning view)
  fixes      print the fix catalog (finding id -> pack surface -> control)
