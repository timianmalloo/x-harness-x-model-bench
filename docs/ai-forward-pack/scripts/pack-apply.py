"""pack-apply.py — apply the AI-Forward deployment map to a repo, mechanically and reversibly.

`/updatepack` and `/addpacktorepo` used to hand-apply INSTALL.md's deployment map, so every
step a person could forget - re-pasting a managed block, deleting the wrapped copy of a doc
whose load scope moved, converting CLAUDE.md to the `@AGENTS.md` import, retiring a parity
control that encoded the old invariant - was remembered or it was not. This script IS the
deployment map (INSTALL.md 1), run from the pack source against a target repo:

  pack-apply.py plan  --source <ai-forward clone> --target <repo>     # every action, no writes
  pack-apply.py apply --source <ai-forward clone> --target <repo>     # do it, idempotently

What it does, per artifact family (pack-owned names only - repo-local files are never touched):

  knowledge   -> .claude/knowledge/<name>.md verbatim; .github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md
                 (applyTo-wrapped) for load: always|glob; .github/knowledge/<name>.md for
                 load: skill|reference; the STALE copy in the other Copilot location is removed
                 (CTX-E: a doc re-scoped to on-demand must stop attaching).
  skills      -> .claude/skills/<name>/ (the whole directory: SKILL.md + reference/*.md);
                 .github/prompts/<name>.prompt.md;
                 .grok/skills/<name>/ (same files; Grok Build native, wins over Claude-compat scan)
  agents      -> .claude/agents/ (both sets); .github/agents/<name>.agent.md (renamed, `tools:` stripped);
                 .grok/agents/<name>.md (`_agent` suffix stripped, `tools:` stripped)
  bundle      -> docs/ai-forward-pack/{templates,scripts,hooks,README,OVERVIEW,research-synthesis,
                 INSTALL,context-budget.json}; .github/hooks/ai-forward.json; .claude/settings.json
                 (hooks merged, showThinkingSummaries set); .grok/hooks/ai-forward.json;
                 .grok/rules/grok-surface.md (path map only — not knowledge docs); .gitignore lines;
                 docs/index.html only if absent; docs/docs-index.js NEVER (V10)
  front doors -> AGENTS.md: the managed block replaced wholesale between markers (appended if absent).
                 CLAUDE.md: converted to `@AGENTS.md` + the addendum block (CTX-B); the old file is
                 backed up under docs/ai-forward-pack/retired/, and every paragraph that is NOT in
                 AGENTS.md (after toolchain-path normalisation) is kept above the addendum.
  controls    -> a repo-local parity test that asserts CLAUDE.md carries the standing-method block
                 (the OLD invariant) is rewritten into a shim asserting the NEW invariant through
                 pack-doctor, its other assertions carried over where they can be read; the original
                 is backed up beside the CLAUDE.md backup.

Repo-local deviations are honoured, not reverted: a destination that differs from the version the
repo received at its installed revision is three-way merged (`git merge-file`) against the pack's
old and new text; a clean merge lands as MERGE, a conflicting one is left untouched with the new
pack text written under docs/ai-forward-pack/conflicts/ and reported as CONFLICT for the skill to
reconcile. The installed revision advances only in `apply`. Re-running is a no-op.

Python 3.8+, stdlib only. Exit 0 = applied/clean, 1 = conflicts or errors reported, 2 = usage.

# it. Other shapes satisfy the invariant too -- a repo that commits its per-run records
# under `.agents/` (a coordination log, an episode-capture log) satisfies it by the wider
# route, and for THAT repo this blanket is wrong: tracked files stay tracked and look fine
# while every new record becomes invisible. So the pattern is CONDITIONAL below, and the
# check is `git check-ignore --quiet <representative path>` -- exit 0 means ignored.
# Never `-v`: with -v the exit code means "some pattern matched", and a `!` negation
# counts, so it exits 0 for a re-included path and inverts the answer (measured).

# D10 (ratified 2026-09-19): the coord ledgers `.agents/log/` are TRACKED by default - git is the
# durable and cross-machine path for state-changing mail (their body-less twins). The mail
# inboxes `.agents/mail/` are machine-local and carry bodies, so they are ignored by an EXPLICIT
# line that holds even when the `.agents/*` blanket is withheld below.

# A .gitignore is LAST-MATCH-WINS, so a blanket appended below an existing rule silently
# reverses it. Measured 2026-09-09 in a consuming repo: line 495 recorded "spikes/ is NOT
# ignored in this repo (pack default overridden) ... (Test Architect gate, 2026-08-26)";
# this block re-appended a blanket `spikes/` twenty-nine lines later and won. 117 tracked
# spike files became reachable only with `git add -f`, and a forgotten `-f` loses evidence
# with NO signature -- `git add -A` drops a NEW ignored file silently, `git status` never
# lists it, and the commit succeeds. The default is not the defect; appending it over a
# recorded decision is.
#
# Three deterministic guards, no heuristics and no comment-parsing:
#   1. a CONDITIONAL line is withheld when the repo's own state answers its condition;
#   2. a line the repo already re-includes is REPORTED, never appended;
#   3. `# pack-apply: decline <pattern>` makes a declination survive the next refresh --
#      without it, deleting the line is undone by the following `/updatepack`.
# Every withholding produces a KEEP row. Silence was the whole problem.

# INSTALL.md 2 has always carried this condition and this script applied it unconditionally:
# "add `spikes/` to `.gitignore` UNLESS a probe is worth keeping as evidence." A repo that
# TRACKS files under spikes/ has already answered that, in the only way git records an answer.
